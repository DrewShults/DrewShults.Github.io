I am an enthusiastic, reliable, hardworking individual with experience in several programming
languages as well as customer service based IT support. I have over 4 years experience in Software
Engineering combined with IT Support roles. I excelled during my time in School for Software
Engineering with a 3.57 gpa. Some of the programming languages I am experienced in include C#,
JavaScript, Java, VB.net, HTML/CSS, work in MS SQL Database, and minor work in Python as well. I
have solid grasp of OOP style programming but am also prepared to use and learn any other tools/
methods needed to get the job done well. Some of the projects I've done include creating an Asset
Tracking System in C# with an SQL Database, A side shooter Arcade game in VB.net, Several HTML/
CSS websites for school/ family, A horse betting game in C#, a simple hangman game in Python, and several
other personal projects. I meet any deadlines set, and don't make promises I can't keep. I'm a team
player but can go solo if I need to. I love learning something new each day, am constantly trying my very best to hone my skills and become the best version of me possible. I am open to remote jobs
and relocation. I look forward to helping your business excel and providing you with great customer
service.<br>

<u>Freelance Software Engineer</u><br>
Freelance<br>
January 2018 – January 2021<br>
Short-term private freelance projects with select clientele.
Focus on Back-End Database development with SQL, C# using MSSMS and ASP.Net.
Some DBA work with focus being database and application development.
These projects were not constant but I was working on development projects on my free time to improve my development skills and learn.
I accepted this extra workload in order to improve my SQL and Programming skills while employed fulltime at other positions.
Some of the projects I worked on consist of creating a database for an internal employee benefit/PTO tracking app, helping my dad with his website, developing databases to replace bulky excel spreadsheets for internal data, developing an application to track customer orders rather than easily misplaced paper files, and assisting in creating a database for an app to track monthly business costs.
Some accomplishments include helping companies reduce paper waste, reduce misplaced documents, increase employee productivity, decreasing loss of revenue, and helping companies keep important data in a centralized location.<br>
